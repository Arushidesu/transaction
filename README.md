# Transaction

## How it works?
  Basically, the program is used to manage product buying and selling transactions. Transactions are stored in the **transaction.txt** file and are based on the products present in the **products.txt** file.
  When the purchase of a product occurs, the program adds in the stock of products and when there is sale, subtract.
